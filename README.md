# Data-Capstone-Project
## Emergency (911) Calls 

### Project at a Glance:
- The objective is to demonstrate an understanding of all previous course material relating to Python for data analysis using Numpy, Pandas, and  visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.  
- Project Tools: Python (libraries: Numpy, Pandas) Data Visualization Tools: Matplotlib and Seaborn 
- Emergency (911) Calls Data: Fire, Traffic, EMS for Montgomery County, PA from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mchirico/montcoalert). 

### Tasks:
1. Get Data 
2. Prepare Data 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis 
4. Deal with any Missing Data 
5. Create New Features 
6. Use Data Visualization

### Result:
As a result, I found that a high volume of 911 (emergency calls) in Montgomery County Pennsylvania related to EMS and Traffic accidents around 3 to 6 p.m. With the high volume of traffic accident calls, accidents could interfere with EMS arrival time. With this information, Montgomery County can plan to improve safety protocols and emergency measures to promote better outcomes for the County.
